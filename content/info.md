Enkibot is an essential resource for [Four Job Fiesta](https://fourjobfiesta.com), but its GameFAQs-esque plain text `CTRL+F` approach isn't always the most useful: especially on mobile.

Shiny Enkibot attempts to improve its presentation for people that want that, resolving the following drawbacks of the original:

- Styles not plain text, for readability.
- Collapsible sections, for focus and easy scrolling to the desired section
- Mobile friendly
- Filter jobs on the fly; no need to resubmit / fill out all slots with one job
- Parse tips to make links active
