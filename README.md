# Shiny Enkibot

This is a shinier web frontend for [Enkibot]'s data.

[Enkibot] is a very useful helper for [Final Fantasy V].
It's designed for assisting with strategies for [Four Job Fiesta], but is a useful repository of job and boss tips for any playthrough.

# Getting Started

`mpm install` for dependencies.

For development, fetch and build a local copy of Enkibot's data: `npm run build:data`.
Then `npm start` to run the dev server

For production, just `npm run build` and deploy the static site.
